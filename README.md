### About Me

I'm a software developer working for Qualcomm on Machine Learning (ML) compilers and ML model performance simulations
and projections on Qualcomm hardware. In the past I worked for IBM Canada on the 
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse/openj9">Eclipse OpenJ9</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/omr">Eclipse OMR</a> projects
as a committer where I was heavily involved in <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/omr/graphs/contributors">contributing</a> code, 
<a href="https://github.com/eclipse/omr/pulls?q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+reviewed-by%3Afjeremic+is%3Aclosed+">reviewing</a>
contributions, and open-source community involvement.

My passion is system's level programming and in particular compiler development (static and dynamic), programming
languages (design and implementation), machine learning, data science, parallelization, computer graphics, software
protection, reverse engineering, and malware analysis.
