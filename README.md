### About Me

Hi, I'm Filip. I'm a just-in-time (JIT) compiler developer based in Toronto, Canada. I'm currently working for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/ca/en/">IBM Canada</a> on <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/openj9">Eclipse OpenJ9</a> and <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/omr">Eclipse OMR</a> projects.

My passion is system's level programming and in particular compiler development (static and dynamic), programming languages (design and implementation), parallelization, computer graphics, software protection, reverse engineering, malware analysis, and cryptography.
